# FastbuilderDocs
An inofficial help document for the Fastbuilder Plugin from _MinusOne_

## What is this Doc about?
This Document is to help the people that bought MinusOne's Fastbuilder plugin but don't know how to set everything up. To me: I am Donut4GAMER and an early supporter of MinusOne's Fastbuilder Plugin.

## Requirements
- a Spigot 1.8.8 Minecraft server
- Java 8+

## Basic Setup
If you bought MinusOne's Fastbuilder make sure to join his Discord: https://discord.gg/tbQDeSZ3FU and open a support ticket and claim your License.

1. Drag the Fastbuilder Plugin into your /plugins/ folder of your server
2. Start your server
3. Fastbuilder won't start since you need to fill in the license you got on his Discord server
4. Then restart your server
5. Configure everything you want to change (e.g. guis.yml or config.yml)
6. Reboot your server and you are ready to go

## Setup Arenas
Now we want to create a mode to play Fastbuilder.

1. Type: /fb addmode <modename> <is diagonal (yes/no> || Please not that Diagonal has bugs in it! MinusOne is fixing it soon
2. Go to the spawn of your island and type: /fb set <modename> <islandnumber>
3. (optional) Go to your plugins folder and open the arenas.yml file. There you can configure where the Mode Switcher NPC should stand
4. Join the arena
- On a single server: Type: /fb join <modename>
- On a Bungeecord server: Rejoin your server or use 4.1 if you don't want to rejoin
